# -stock-recommendation-system-using-a-machine-learning-
 This project developed a stock recommendation system using a machine learning model trained on real-time financial data web-scraped from the Screener website. The goal was to build a predictive model that could recommend whether to invest in a particular stock based on its historical financial performance. 
The project found that the GradientBoostingClassifier model performed the best, with an accuracy of 77%. This means that the model correctly classified 77% of the stocks in the test set. The project concluded that the GradientBoostingClassifier model is a promising tool for stock recommendation. However, the model was only trained on data from the Indian stock market.
